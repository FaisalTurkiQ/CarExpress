# Car Management API

This project is a simple Express.js API for managing car information with MongoDB.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up MongoDB:

Make sure MongoDB is installed and running.
Update the MongoDB connection string in the code (replace 'mongodb://localhost:27017/test' with your actual connection string).
Usage
Start the Express application:
bash
Copy code
npm start
The server will be running at http://localhost:3334.

Use Postman for testing API endpoints:

GET all cars: GET http://localhost:3334/cars
GET a specific car by ID: GET http://localhost:3334/cars/:id
POST a new car: POST http://localhost:3334/cars
PUT (update) a car by ID: PUT http://localhost:3334/cars/:id
DELETE a car by ID: DELETE http://localhost:3334/cars/:id
For database interaction, you can use Mongo Compass for a GUI interface or MongoDB Atlas for a cloud-based MongoDB solution.

Additional Information
This project uses Mongoose for MongoDB interaction.
The application runs on PORT 3334.
Feel free to explore and modify the code as needed!

Remember to replace placeholders like `yourusername/your-repo` with your actual GitHub username and repository name. This README provides a brief overview of how to install dependencies, set up the MongoDB connection, run the server, and test the API using Postman.
